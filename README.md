## Tutorials Root Folder ##

This folder contains the following items:

- The `metadata.json` file containing the **keys of the active tutorials and their order** in the Telerik Platform.
- **System folders** like `images`.
- A **separated folder** for **each tutorial** like `quick-start`. Bear in mind that the **name** of each **tutorial folder** is taken as its **key**.
- The `new-tutorial-template` folder containing the basic information about the structure of each tutorial. It can be used as a start point for the new tutorials.

> Please follow [these steps](http://tap.telerik.com/process/tutorials, "Update Telerik Platform tutorials based on the repository") in order to get the **Telerik Platform tutorials updated** after a **repository change**.
