## Tutorials Root Folder ##

This folder contains the following items:

- **System folders** like `images` and `new-tutorial-template`.

> Take a look at the `new-tutorial-template` folder containing the basic information about the structure of each tutorial and some sample files. It can be used as a start point for the new tutorials

- A **separate folder** for **each tutorial** like `quick-start`. Bear in mind that the **name** of each **tutorial folder** is taken as its **key**.
- The `metadata.json` file - it contains the **keys of the active tutorials and their order** in the Telerik Platform.

> Please follow [these steps](http://tap.telerik.com/process/tutorials#sync-tutorials "Update Telerik Platform tutorials based on the repository") in order to get the **Telerik Platform tutorials updated** after a **repository change**.
