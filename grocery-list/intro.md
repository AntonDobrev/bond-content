# Adding Data Services, Authentication, and User Management

Data is an important component of most applications. The Telerik Platform contains a Backend Services solution that makes it simple to configure and interact with a backend that lives in the cloud. In this lesson you'll create a backend structure for managing grocery lists. Within a few minutes you'll have a complete data service, a UI that reads and writes to it, a login screen, and even a screen for user registration. Let's get started.

> Note: This tutorial should start the user in a newly created “Grocery List app” workspace. The workspace should have an AppBuilder project named “Grocery List”, which is a clone of https://github.com/tjvantoll/bond-grocery-list.git.
