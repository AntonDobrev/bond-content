# Adding Data Services, Authentication, and User Management

TODO: Is this a good name for this file? Should I have an overall description of the tutorial here?

Note: This tutorial should start the user in a newly created “Grocery List app” workspace. The workspace should have an AppBuilder project named “Grocery List”, which is a clone of https://github.com/tjvantoll/bond-grocery-list.git (which I'll move to the icenium organization soon).
